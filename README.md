# TrafficTelligence 🚦
**Advanced Traffic Volume Estimation using Machine Learning**

TrafficTelligence is a smart traffic analysis system that uses machine learning models to estimate and predict traffic volume based on historical data, weather, time, and other variables. This project demonstrates a complete pipeline from data preprocessing to prediction and visualization.

📌 Live Demo & Output Screens
✅ 1. Input Page – index.html

Users can enter details like holiday, temperature, rain, snow, weather, and date-time information.
This data is submitted to the backend for prediction.

✅ 2. Sample Input

Example: A rainy day on August 15th, 2015 at 4 PM (Independence Day).
The model takes these features and estimates traffic volume accordingly.
